As we just needed to add the icons in a horizontal row, I did not implement the coordinate functionality
where I could have placed the icons at specified coordinates.

I first thought that we had to create our own Icon interface with just one method: addIcon but the implementation
I did seems more logical and rational. The tester class is creating the MarsIcon as well as showing the message but 
it is not showing the globe picture. Maybe it has something to do with the naming or some other minor reason.
