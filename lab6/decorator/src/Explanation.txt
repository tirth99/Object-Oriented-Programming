I had to negate 1 when drawing rectangle or box around MarsIcon because if I didn't, 
the lines on the right or the bottom would not show. I think this is because the 
Message box or MarsIcon is overlapping and hence I negate 1.

I would like to know the exact reason if you could let me know after checking the code.
